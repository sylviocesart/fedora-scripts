Alternative solution

As an alternative to the gnome-shell extension, it's also possible to use nemo to handle only the desktop.


Instructions

1) Install nemo from your distribution's repositories. On Fedora, enter this command on the Terminal application:

sudo dnf install nemo

2)  Open a text editor and copy the following text into a new empty file:

[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Nemo
Comment=Start Nemo desktop at log in
Exec=nemo-desktop
OnlyShowIn=GNOME;
AutostartCondition=GSettings org.nemo.desktop show-desktop-icons
X-GNOME-AutoRestart=true
NoDisplay=true
3) Save the text file as ~/.config/autostart/nemo-autostart-with-gnome.desktop

And that's it!
Next time you log in, nemo will automatically display icons over the desktop background.
If you don't want to log out, you can also manually start it using the Alt+F2 prompt to run nemo-desktop

Optional step:
In case you want Nemo to behave more similarly to nautilus desktop layout, you can enable the setting running this command on the terminal:

gsettings set org.nemo.desktop use-desktop-grid false
